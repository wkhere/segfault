========

USAGE
-----
% cc segfault.c
% ./a.out      
zsh: segmentation fault  ./a.out

PURPOSE
-------

You can learn a lot from this. For example, what exit code is returned
upon segfault. Or that you really should use zsh, if you're a hacker.

Even if you're a recruiter, you can learn that I can write segfaulting
code *intentionally*. Well, I've written my first worm which made
servers cry back in 1995, no wonder I reminded myself how to write 
a segfaulting code *in a clean way* in 2009. 

Just think of it: so many mandays and code lines are being wasted 
all over the world, they can cost thousands of dollars and then
the product still segfaults.

As you can see, I can write properly segfaulting code in 3 (three)
nicely-formatted lines.

Hope this makes a difference for you.
